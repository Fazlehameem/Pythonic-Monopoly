Rental Analysis 

How to you a Dashboard

Create a new dashboard.ipynb for your dashboard code. Copy over the code for each visualization (from rental analysis.ipynb) and place this into separate functions (1 function per visualization). This will make it easier to build and modify the layout later. Each function should return the plot figure in a format that Panel can use to plot the visualization.
